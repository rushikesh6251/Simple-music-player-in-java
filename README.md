Title: Music Player Application

Description:
This Java project is a simple music player application developed by Rushikesh for learning and practice purposes. The application allows users to create playlists, add songs to them, and control playback options such as playing the next or previous song, replaying the current song, and deleting songs from the playlist.

Key Features:
- Create and manage playlists.
- Add songs to playlists.
- Control playback options including playing the next or previous song, replaying the current song, and deleting songs from the playlist.
- Utilizes Java collections (ArrayList, LinkedList) for managing playlists and songs.
- Implements basic user input handling for interacting with the application via the command line.
- Provides a simple and intuitive user interface with text-based menus.

This project serves as a foundation for building more advanced music player applications and provides valuable experience in working with Java collections, user input handling, and basic application design. Feel free to explore, modify, and expand upon this project for your own learning and development purposes.

thank you!!
